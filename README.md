Javascript Final Project - Budget Planner

It's a page for your budgeting planning. In order to monitor your spending, submit your income & add your expenses based on the given category. As a result you will be able to view your total expenses & balance after spending. The expenses will be shown in the pie chart as well.

Difficulties
1. Manipulating localstorage to store & delete item
2. Converting array of localstorage object to array of array in order to pass data to piechart
3. Cloning of array as the new array keep replacing the orginal array

Area of improvement
1. Add function for user to add new category
2. Update function for replacing category instead forcing the user to delete before insert the same category
3. To improve web design
